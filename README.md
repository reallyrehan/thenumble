## What is Numble?

Numble is a game like Wordle, but for math nerds. You guess an equation in 6 guesses or less, with a new equation every day!

## Keep Numble Alive! üö®
Numble currently costs $96 to run per year.
- $84/year for the [Basic Dyno from Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-types)
- $12/year for the domain from Google Domains

Right now, all of it comes from my pocket (and some donations from amazing Numble-rs).

# How to Contribute?
Make Numble better, however you want, be it a new [equation generator](https://github.com/reallyrehan/thenumble/blob/ffca69ba5da32893bb3b65ec53a4007bb19bc36b/utils.py#L5), or improving the just-get-shit-done frontend code I have written.
